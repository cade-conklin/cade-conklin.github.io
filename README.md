### About me

```markdown
Senior at Oregon State University. Majoring in Computer Science with a Minor in Business Entrepreneurship. My favorite aspect of Software Engineering is the learning that extends beyond a job. Having the ability to deliver well-tested products to customers and pursue interesting projects outside of work is what makes SWE unique. Using Natural Langauge Processing and Regular Expressions, I created a Twitter Bot that turned tweets into Madlibs. Outside of work, I am probably the biggest Portland Trail Blazers fan you will meet!
