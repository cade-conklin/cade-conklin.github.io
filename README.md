# About me

```markdown
Senior at Oregon State University. Majoring in Computer Science with a Minor in Business Entrepreneurship. My favorite aspect of Software Engineering is the \n  learning that extends beyond a job. Having the ability to deliver well-tested products to customers and pursue interesting projects outside of work is what makes\n  SWE unique. Using Natural Langauge Processing and Regular Expressions, I created a Twitter Bot that turned tweets into Madlibs. Outside of work, I am \n
probably the biggest Portland Trail Blazers fan you will meet!

# Projects
### Pothole Detection App
[Pothole Detection Application](https://github.com/cade-conklin/Pothole-Detection)
The Pothole Detection App was made in partnership with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT).  The purpose it serves is to automatically detect potholes that are driven over so that road crews can be sent to fix them quicker.  Some of the features include: car sensitivity, pothole detection, map showing nearest/newest potholes, login for ODOT workers, and drive tracking technology.  I implemented the pothole detection algorithm which uses the mobile phone accelerometer data to tracks sudden changes in acceleration in the X and Y direction.  Any numbers above a certain threshold, depending on the car, will trigger a pothole to be put on the map.
